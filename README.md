# liri-node-app

This code is an assignment for the University of Richmond coding bootcamp. I created a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives back data using packages from Twitter, Spotify, and Request.

This program works using the command prompt window. One will run the liri.js selecting one of the following: my-tweets, spotify-this-song, movie-this, or do-what-it-says. If one chooses spotify-this-song or movie-this, you will need to specify song or movie choice e.g. movie-choice Black Panther.

*Please note one needs to populate a dotenv file to run this program with one's own appropriate keys per search request.
